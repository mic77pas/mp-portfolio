    about:
      "The University of Waterloo is a leading Canadian research university known for its innovation, co-op programs, and strong emphasis on STEM and technology. With over 100 undergraduate programs across faculties like Engineering, Mathematics, Science, and Environment, Waterloo combines rigorous academics with hands-on experiential learning. It is widely recognized for its co-op program, which integrates paid work terms into students’ studies, fostering industry-ready graduates and strong connections with global employers. The university’s culture encourages entrepreneurship, research, and interdisciplinary collaboration, making it a hub for students passionate about problem-solving, technology, and innovation.",
    do: "During my first year in Geomatics, I explored the fundamentals of spatial data, mapping, and geographic information systems. I completed coursework in topics like surveying, remote sensing, cartography, and geospatial analysis while developing practical skills using tools such as GIS software and data visualization platforms. I also collaborated on small projects and labs, applying theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios and building a strong foundation in technical problem-solving.",
    learn:
      "I gained a deep understanding of spatial data management, geospatial analysis, and the applications of technology in mapping and surveying. I also learned how to approach complex problems methodically, work effectively on collaborative projects, and integrate technical skills with critical thinking. Most importantly, I discovered my passion for combining technical problem-solving with design and systems thinking, which ultimately inspired my transition into Systems Design Engineering.",

    about:
      "IpserLab is an early-stage startup focused on building innovative software solutions that solve real-world problems. As a small but fast-moving team, the company emphasizes rapid iteration, collaboration between engineers and founders, and a strong product-driven approach. It provides interns and employees with hands-on exposure to both front-end and back-end development, fostering a practical understanding of software engineering workflows, Agile practices, and startup culture.",
    do: "During my internship at IpserLab, I designed and implemented front-end features using React and TypeScript, collaborating closely with founders and engineers to define requirements and align with the product vision. I gained exposure to Java-based backend systems, APIs, and deployment workflows, and participated in Agile sprints and code reviews. My contributions helped reduce feature turnaround time by 15% while improving overall product quality.",
    learn:
      "I strengthened my front-end development skills, particularly with React and TypeScript, and deepened my understanding of how front-end and back-end systems interact in a startup environment. I learned how to translate product requirements into efficient code, collaborate effectively in Agile workflows, and adapt to the fast-paced demands of an early-stage company. Additionally, I developed a better sense of product thinking and the importance of aligning technical decisions with business goals.",

    about:
      "The Systems Design Engineering (SYDE) program at the University of Waterloo combines engineering, design, and human-centered problem solving to prepare students for interdisciplinary technical challenges. The curriculum emphasizes systems thinking, collaboration, and both software and hardware development, equipping students with the skills to design complex systems that integrate technology, user experience, and business considerations. SYDE students gain hands-on experience through projects, labs, and co-op opportunities, fostering a strong foundation in both technical and design-oriented skills.",
    do: "",
    // "During my 1A term, I completed core courses in engineering fundamentals, programming, design thinking, and systems modeling. I engaged in lab sessions and team projects that required me to apply problem-solving techniques, develop software prototypes, and analyze system-level trade-offs. I also began integrating design principles with technical knowledge, learning to approach problems from both functional and user-centered perspectives.",
    learn: "",
      // "I developed a foundational understanding of systems design principles, engineering problem-solving, and interdisciplinary collaboration. I strengthened my programming and modeling skills, learned to approach technical challenges holistically, and gained experience working in team settings on complex projects. Most importantly, I refined my ability to combine technical solutions with design considerations, laying the groundwork for future SYDE projects and co-op experiences.",
